Blade is a software engineer. 
He have been focus on text-searching and distributed data flow design and implementation for over three year. 
Before that, he had over three year experiment to capture 3 dimensional object rotation and position features with leverage of computer vision until he finished his physic master degree. Recently he focus on his own projects with more fundamental engineering detail about OS and embedded system developments.

Between his daily works, he is crazy about bouldering and playing guitar. Maybe it is next projects to some cool devices about these two habits.
