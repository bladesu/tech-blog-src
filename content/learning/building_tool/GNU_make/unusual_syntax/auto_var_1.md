title: "Automatic Variables: $@ and $< pair"

### note:
- __$@__ is the __file name__ of the target of the rule. Also it apply the __pattern rules__ for multiple files.
- __$<__ is the name of the first prerequiste. It also follow the implicit rule.
- __$@__ can not be used within the prerequisites list except __secondary expansion__ feature is applied

## case study
```make
*.o: *.c dependency.h 
	gcc -c -o $@ $< -I. 
```
In this case, I define the rule that if each file suffixed with __.c__ or named __denpendency.h__ are updated. Here the new file with the same prefixed name but ended with __.o__ should be generated by gcc with __-I__ option acting on current directory. For coder in c, it should be known that __gcc -c__ generate only object file (__.o__).
