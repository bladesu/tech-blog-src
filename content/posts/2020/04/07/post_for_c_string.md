A new post here:
[https://bladesu.github.io/learning/computer_languages/c_lang/confusing_concepts/pointer_to_char_and_string/](https://bladesu.github.io/learning/computer_languages/c_lang/confusing_concepts/pointer_to_char_and_string/)

I introduce the some knowledge in C language for __string__ processing here. Do you confuse about __string__ in __C__? __char *__, __string literal__, __char array__, which one should I use in some case? If you have same problem, please read this article.
