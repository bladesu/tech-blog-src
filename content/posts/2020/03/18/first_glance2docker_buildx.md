A new update here: [learning/devops/cross_compilation/dockerized/0000_first_try.md]({{< ref "learning/devOps/cross_compilation/dockerized/0000_first_try.md" >}})

Here I introduce the new **docker desktop** feature which integrated with **qemu** and **docker buildx** command. Now we can build applications in docker images executed with different CPU architectures and run them above operation system with docker environment installed.
