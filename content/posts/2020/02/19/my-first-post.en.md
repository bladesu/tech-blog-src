 Thank you for reading this post. This is the first one in my blog.

 Since I had connected to internect, I got a lot of knowlege from enormous amount of website. However it really hard to digest and organize all of them.

 So I start this blog to put my idea and information collected. If I take something wrong, or you gain from something here. Please give me feedback, thank you.
