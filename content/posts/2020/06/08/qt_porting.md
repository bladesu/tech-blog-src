Here I make a practice for application porting to ARM-based environment with leverage of docker container as build platform. This post contains not only application porting but also the Qt library. Finally I demonstrate the GUI application on a target platform(OrangePi, with sunxi H6 CPU) via VNC connection. Here is the link [https://bladesu.github.io/learning/devops/cross_compilation/porting_app/qt_porting_orange_pi/](https://bladesu.github.io/learning/devops/cross_compilation/porting_app/qt_porting_orange_pi/).
