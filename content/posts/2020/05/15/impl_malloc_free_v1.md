Recently I implement a easier version of malloc and free.
It is a practice of implementation of malloc and free to see the detail of how heap memory manipulation with system call by wraping functions in malloc library. Here is the link:[https://bladesu.github.io/learning/linux_app/memory/impl_malloc_free_v1/](https://bladesu.github.io/learning/linux_app/memory/impl_malloc_free_v1/).
