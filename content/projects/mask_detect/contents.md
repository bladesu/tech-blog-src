# Goal:

Since the end of 2019, the Coronavirus pandemic hurt millions of people and cause panic around people. It had been reported that wearing mask to cover months could protect people from infections transmitted by respiratory droplets. So I think it is a good idea to develop a real time alarming device which could be sent to a public gate like train station or airport to help passenger or supervisor  to remind people should wear their mask proper or kick out someone is not willing to wear a mask.
